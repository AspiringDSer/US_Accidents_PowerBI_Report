# US Accidents - PowerBI Report

# Preface 
This README documents about the project. I also have experience in created Tableau Dashboards [COVID19 Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/AspiringDSer/COVID19_Tableau_Dashboard) 

This README document provides an overview of the **US Accidents PowerBI report**, detailing its objectives, methodologies, and key findings. The project aims to [briefly describe the project's goals]. It leverages Tableau to create interactive visualizations that [describe what the visualizations aim to achieve or demonstrate].
    
The project's visualizations and analyses are based on [US Accidents (2016-2023) Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). 
This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers **49 states of the USA**. The accident data were collected from **February 2016 to March 2023**, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately **7.7 million** accident records. For more information about this dataset, please visit [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents).

This README serves as a guide to understanding the project's scope, methodology, and findings, providing a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the data further.
